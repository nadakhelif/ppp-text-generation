## Introduction

In this application, we utilize a pretrained transformer model, specifically **GPT-2**, to generate poems. By fine-tuning the model on a dataset of poems, we enable it to learn the patterns, styles, and themes present in poetry. The application provides an interactive interface where you can input a prompt or a few lines of text, and the model will generate a poem based on the given input.
