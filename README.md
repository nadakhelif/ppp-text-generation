## Introduction

In this application, we utilize a pretrained transformer model, specifically **GPT-2**, to generate poems. By fine-tuning the model on a dataset of poems, we enable it to learn the patterns, styles, and themes present in poetry. The application provides an interactive interface where you can input a prompt or a few lines of text, and the model will generate a poem based on the given input.

## Installation

To install the Poem Generation Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the Poem Generation Application, execute the following command:

Once the application is running, follow the on-screen instructions to input your prompt and generate a poem. You can experiment with different prompts, explore various poetic forms, and let your creativity flow!

## Data

The dataset used for training the poem generation model consists of poems organized by form and topic. The application provides options to choose different forms (e.g., haiku, sonnet) and topics (e.g., love, peace) to generate poems based on specific preferences. The dataset is loaded and processed using FastAI's data loaders, making it easy to work with and train the model.

## Model Fine-tuning

The pretrained GPT-2 model is fine-tuned on the chosen dataset of poems. By leveraging FastAI's high-level API, the model is trained using language modeling techniques to capture the essence of poetry. Fine-tuning allows the model to generate coherent and contextually relevant poems based on the input prompts.

## Poem Generation

Once the model is fine-tuned, the application enables users to input a prompt or initial text. The model then generates a poem based on the provided input, leveraging the learned patterns and styles from the training process. The generated poems can serve as a source of inspiration, creative exploration, or even educational material for poetry enthusiasts.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of poems generated by the application:
